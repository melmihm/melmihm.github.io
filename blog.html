    <h2>Blog</h2>
<p> I started this vegan food blog as a class project and really fell in love with the concept. I enjoy coming up with the recipes, taking pictures and sharing my cooking with family and friends. The main purpose of this blog when I first started was to provide cheap, easy and delicious vegan recipes. As a college student, I constantly struggle trying to eat a balanced diet while sticking to my budget. However, with time I began to realize that I don't want my blog to be limited to just food. As awesome and salivating as food blogs are, I found myself getting a little bored talking about one single topic. With that said, I still love cooking and will continue to post recipes, but readers can also expect to see posts on plants, cruelty-free cleaning and beauty products, homemade remedies, etc. Enjoy!</p>

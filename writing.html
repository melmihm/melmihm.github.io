<h3>Independent Florida Alligator</h3>
<a href="http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_3c6950f4-9de2-11e3-b642-001a4bcf887a.html">Oasis for the Homeless</a> 

<p>I was really excited to get the opportunity to write a story about the Catholic Workers Movement. This happens to be the first article I have ever gotten published and I'm happy to say that this was my own story idea. Working with the Florida Independent Alligator was an incredibly rewarding experience and I hope to do it again soon!</p>

<p>I was so excited to get the opportunity to work with the Independent Florida Alligator again. For this story about the first official cohousing community in the state of Florida, I got the opportunity to both report and shoot photos.</p>

<p>This was another awesome experience to work with the Independent Florida Alligator. This story is about the use of a street drug to treat depression. Through a ton of investigative reporting, I learned that ketamine is actually more effective in treating short-term mental problems, such as suicidal thoughts. </p>

<p>Doing this story was a ton of fun! The topic itself was unusual and hilarious, plus my source turned out to give me an incredible interview. </p>

<p style="font-family:courier">I was really excited to get the opportunity to write a story about the Catholic Workers Movement. This happens to be the first article I have ever gotten published and I'm happy to say that this was my own story idea. Working with the Florida Independent Alligator was an incredibly rewarding experience and I hope to do it again soon!</p>

<p style="font-family:courier">I was so excited to get the opportunity to work with the Independent Florida Alligator again. For this story about the first official cohousing community in the state of Florida, I got the opportunity to both report and shoot photos.</p>


<h3 style="font-family:courier">Blog</h3>

 <p style="font-family:courier">I started this blog for a class and have had so much fun doing it. It's a mix of cheap and easy vegan recipes, as well as reviews on vegan restaurants. In addition, I give tips on the best vegan grocery items and how to make the most out of dried herbs and spices. My goal is to help people realize that vegan food isn't bland or expensive. Rather, it can be incredibly cheap and delicious.</p>

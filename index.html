<p>I'm a 22-year-old journalism student currently studying at the University of Florida. I was born and raised in Miami, Fla., and have always had a strong passion for writing and photography. I love to travel as well, even if it just means driving over to a neighboring town. I'm fascinated by anything new. If I haven't seen it, I want to see it. If I haven't done it, I most likely want to do it.</p>
<p>I also have a passion for cooking. I'm traveling to Thailand this summer and hope to expand my palate (and my ability to make pad Thai!). Without a doubt, my camera will be glued to my side and my journal will be rich with exciting stories and experiences.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I hope to one day become an investigative reporter. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve always been curious about the world around me and eager to learn more and do what I can to help. I’m rarely satisfied with my level of knowledge, so I’m always researching and reading. I like to get to the heart of a subject and dig until I find what I’m looking for.</p>
